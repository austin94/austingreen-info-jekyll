In this talk I go over the architecture of the Zendesk Garden Design System
[react components library](https://garden.zendesk.com/react-components/).

I cover our use of [render-props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) and
how Garden leverages them to create flexible and accessible composite widgets using the
`Element -> Container -> View` architecture.
